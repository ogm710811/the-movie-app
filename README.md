# Movies Web Application

## This problem is intended to give you hands-on experience with Nodejs, Express and MongoDB. It shows how to write a Node.js web application that presents users with a form containing three fields and a submit button. The fields should be:
1. title
2. year
3. imdb

## You are going to see how to set up a route to handle a POST request of the form and how this route should use the Node.js MongoDB driver to insert a movie document into MongoDB.
